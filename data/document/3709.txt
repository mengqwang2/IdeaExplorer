Course Registration and Availability.

The idea came to me when I was registering for a course and found that not only was the course itself booked out but the wait list was also full with the result I couldn't register for it.
Courses that have full wait lists could be scheduled for a second time for that particular quarter.
This would ensure that the courses are more readily available and IDP’s could be updated immediately, otherwise a person will have to wait for another scheduling of that course the following quarter. 
I'm assuming the wait list is a substantial one in that the numbers on it would make it viable to schedule a course a second time.
I'm not aware of another way to get around this over booking.
